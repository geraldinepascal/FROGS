Tool1 : preprocess
    INPUTS :
      Usage archive
        Demultiplexed files (R1 and R2 by sample) in archive [TAR.GZ]
      Usage files
        R1 list [FASTQ]
        R2 list [FASTQ]
    OUTPUTS :
        Global (all samples) dereplicated sequences [FASTA]
        Count file (count by sample for each uniq sequence in global fasta) [TSV]
        Summary file (number of sequences by sample in each filtering step) [TSV]

    PARAMETERS :
        [read 1 size (if not already contiged)]
        [read 2 size (if not already contiged)]
        amplicon size
        amplicon min size
        amplicon max size
        5' adaptor sequence
        3' adaptor sequence
        [samples names (in files usage)]

    STEPS :
        Linear                  Parallel                  Note
                                1- flash                  Merges R1 and R2 by overlap fragment
                                2- filterSeq.py           Filters sequences by length
                                3- cutadapt               Trim 5' and 3' adaptor and eliminates sequences where the two adaptors are not present
                                4- filterSeq.py           Filters sequences by N count and length (adaptor can be internal)
                                5- derepSamples.py        Dereplicates by sample.
                                6- usearch                Removes chimera
        7- derepSamples.py                                Dereplicates together all sequences.
